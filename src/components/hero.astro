    <p>
        I am a developer who loves turning ideas into things people can actually use and enjoy. 
        My interest in coding started back in school and grew into a real passion that led me to study Computer Science and help others learn along the way.
       <br><br>
        I have worked on projects that taught me the value of teamwork, creativity, and constant learning. 
        Right now, I am focused on growing my skills and becoming a well-rounded developer who creates meaningful, user-friendly experiences.
