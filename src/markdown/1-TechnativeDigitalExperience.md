At Technative Digital, I worked as a software engineer intern in a six-person agile team, helping build and ship a full-stack playlist app from scratch. I took the lead on the front end, creating responsive UIs, hooking them up to backend APIs, and helping troubleshoot issues across the stack when things didn’t quite behave as expected.
