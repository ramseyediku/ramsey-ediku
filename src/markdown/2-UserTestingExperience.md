At Usertesting, I joined as an automation engineer intern and focused on making everyday workflows smoother and less manual. I built production-ready Jira automation scripts that handled tasks like assigning tickets in rotation and keeping labels clean and compliant, so the team could spend more time actually testing and less time on admin.
